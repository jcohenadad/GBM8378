# GBM8378

Polytechnique Montreal course "Principes d'imagerie biom√©dicale".

This repository includes the lab material for the course 

## Documentation and Ressource

To get started with Python, we recommend [this excellent tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLnzBBbvhjz4X3htDbNF0aJEDVtny48GI0) (in French) made by Guillaume Sheehy. 

## Getting started (with Binder)

Click on the Binder badge:
[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/jcohenadad/GBM8378/master)

Wait for Binder to finish building the environment (can take 5-10 minutes), then click on the Jupyter notebook. E.g.: under `lab3-irm/gbm8378-lab3-irm.ipynb`.

**Warning:** After 10 minutes of inactivity, binder will stop working and you will have to launch it again. [Save your work](https://discourse.jupyter.org/t/getting-your-notebook-after-your-binder-has-stopped/3268) before closing it or it will be lost !

## Getting started (on local station)

1) You will need to [install miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) in order to set-up your python environment.

2) Clone this GitHub repository on your computer:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/jcohenadad/GBM8378.git
cd GBM8378
```
- For Windows user, you might need to [install git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) prior to clone the repository.
- If git clone is not working, you can download the zipped version of the repository and unzip it locally on your computer.

3) Once miniconda is installed and the repository is cloned, run the following commands in order to create your virtual environment and start the jupyter notebook:

Then, run the following to create a virtual environment and start the notebook:

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml # Only do it once in order to create the environment (might take a few minutes)

# Start the jupyter notebooks:
conda activate env-gbm8378  # Do it everytime you wish to run the notebook
jupyter notebook  
```

- Make sure that your prompt is currently on the `GBM8378` folder when you call the `environment.yml` file.
- For Windows user, you might need to type these commands in `Anaconda Prompt` if `cmd` does not recognize `conda`.

**Make sure that you have the last version of the files by pulling the repo before every new lab** (`git pull`). Move your Notebooks elsewhere if you don't want them to be overwritten by the new clone. 

## Create PDF
While on the jupyter notebook, print the page and export/save as PDF.
